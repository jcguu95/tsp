* Timestamp properties (tsp)

TODO

;; Timestamp Properties
;;
;; The main function #'tsp:file-prop should do exactly one thing:
;; provided a timestamp (e.g. "20210325-160115"), it pulls
;; everything of interest into a list.

* Road map

+ Have a s-exp based ts database! Update when an associated file
  has been updated since last check. Allow force update as well.

   From db like this, we can make a directed graph (another db!)
  and write an exporter for this db.. export to an org buffer.

+ From a file whose name contains a timestring, let the user be
  able to quickly get to the exported buffer, in which all
  associated files are presented and linked. If no data is
  available, ask the user if initiate.

+ Add GIFs.
