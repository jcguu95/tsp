* Timestamp properties (tsp)

TODO

* Road map

1. Have a s-exp based ts database! Update when an associated file
   has been updated since last check. Allow force update as well.

    From db like this, we can make a directed graph (another db!)
   and write an exporter for this db.. export to an org buffer.


2. From a file whose name contains a timestring, let the user be
   able to quickly get to the exported buffer, in which all
   associated files are presented and linked. If no data is
   available, ask the user if initiate.
