* Timestamp properties (tsp)

TODO

* Road map

+ [X] Have a s-exp based ts database! Update when an associated file has been updated since last check. Allow force update as well.

  Check out =tsp-db.el=.

+ [X] From a file whose name contains a timestamp, let the user be able to quickly get to the exported buffer, in which all associated files are presented and linked.

  Check out =tsp:export-ts-prop-of-file-to-buffer=.

  (TODO - If no data is available, ask the user if initiate.)

+ [ ] Add GIFs.
